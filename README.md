# TEXT DETECTION USING OPENCV 

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** Text detection using OpenCV

**Team Members:** 
- Ahmad Hazim Bin Ahmad Rizal
- Mohamad Adam Danieal Bin Sluhudin Hamdan
- Adhwa Danish Bin Mohamad Noor
- Ahmad Nabil Bin Zulkifli


**Objectives:**
- To detect texts depicted in the image of the camera.
- To be able to convert the texts in the image into string.
- To enable users to copy and paste long texts detected in the image.

##  B. ABSTRACT 

This AI is created for the purpose of helping students with their research in their respective subjects. Be that as it may, but there are some materials (in forms of PDF) that
only has images in them. The texts and pages are all uploaded in images in the PDF which makes it hard for students to cite the materials into their written assignment as a
supporting answer. With this AI, the images in the PDF that has texts can be detected and converted into string. That way, the texts in the image, which weren't copiable then,
can now be copied into their written assignment. Problem solved.

Blind people rely on other senses apart from their sight senses. Having said that, they can't read texts from books or any other information pieces. However, nowadays we have a text-to-speech voice technology that detects string-type characters and converts it into a voice. It would be as if someone is reading you a book. With the 'Text Detection' AI, all we have to do is capture an image of the book's page and have it convert it into string. The string characters we obtained can be copied into the text-to-speech voice technology.

Figure 1 shows the AI output of detecting which user is not wearing a face mask or inappropriate face mask.


## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
- Detect face masks in real-time video streams

We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our face mask detector.


There is two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector as shown in Figure 2:

Figure 2: Phases and individual steps for building a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision and deep learning 

In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps (as shown by Figure 1 above):

- Training: Here we’ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras/TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk

- Deployment: Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask

We’ll review each of these phases and associated subsets in detail in the remainder of this tutorial, but in the meantime, let’s take a look at the dataset we’ll be using to train our COVID-19 face mask detector.


Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset as shown in Figure 3:

![Figure 3](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_dataset.jpg)

Figure 3: A face mask detection dataset consists of “with mask” and “without mask” images. 

The dataset we’ll be using here today was created by PyImageSearch reader Prajna Bhandary.

This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:

- with_mask: 690 images
- without_mask: 686 images

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether a person is or is not wearing a mask.

How was our face mask dataset created?
Prajna, like me, has been feeling down and depressed about the state of the world — thousands of people are dying each day, and for many of us, there is very little (if anything) we can do.

To help keep her spirits up, Prajna decided to distract herself by applying computer vision and deep learning to solve a real-world problem:

- Best case scenario — she could use her project to help others
- Worst case scenario — it gave her a much needed mental escape


## D.   PROJECT STRUCTURE

The following directory is our structure of our project:

- 5 directories, 10 files


The dataset/ directory contains the data described in the “Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset” section.

Three image examples/ are provided so that you can test the static image face mask detector.

We’ll be reviewing three Python scripts in this tutorial:

- train_mask_detector.py: Accepts our input dataset and fine-tunes MobileNetV2 upon it to create our mask_detector.model. A training history plot.png containing accuracy/loss curves is also produced
- detect_mask_image.py: Performs face mask detection in static images
- detect_mask_video.py: Using your webcam, this script applies face mask detection to every frame in the stream

In the next two sections, we will train our face mask detector.



## E   TRAINING THE COVID-19 FACE MASK DETECTION

We are now ready to train our face mask detector using Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

From there, open up a terminal, and execute the following command:

Figure 4: Figure 10: COVID-19 face mask detector training accuracy/loss curves demonstrate high accuracy and little signs of overfitting on the data

As you can see, we are obtaining ~99% accuracy on our test set.

Looking at Figure 4, we can see there are little signs of overfitting, with the validation loss lower than the training loss. 

Given these results, we are hopeful that our model will generalize well to images outside our training and testing set.


## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

You can then launch the mask detector in real-time video streams using the following command:
- $ python detect_mask_video.py
- [INFO] loading face detector model...
- INFO] loading face mask detector model...
- [INFO] starting video stream...

Figure 5: Mask detector in real-time video streams

In Figure 5, you can see that our face mask detector is capable of running in real-time (and is correct in its predictions as well.



## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, we learned how to create a Text Recognition AI program using OpenCV.

We also used Tesseract optical character recognition(OCR) to detect any characters in the image.

We then took this face mask classifier and applied it to images that has quotes or sentences that be it from a pdf file or any inspirational quotes from the internet.

The program specializes in detecting characters in images and enable them to be copied and pasted since the sentences inside the image has been converted into string and can, therefore be manipulated.

Our simple program also includes a small user interface for the user to insert the image into the program.
